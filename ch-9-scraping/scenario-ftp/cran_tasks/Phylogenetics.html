        The history of life unfolds within a phylogenetic context. Comparative phylogenetic methods are statistical approaches for analyzing historical patterns along phylogenetic trees.  This task view describes R packages that implement a variety of different comparative phylogenetic methods.  This is an active research area and much of the information is subject to change. One thing to note is that many important packages are not on CRAN: either they were formerly on CRAN and were later archived (for example, if they failed to incorporate necessary changes as R is updated) or they are developed elsewhere and have not been put on CRAN yet. Such packages may be found on github, R-forge, or authors' websites.

        <i>
          Getting trees into R
        </i>: Trees in R are usually stored in the S3 phylo class (implemented in
<a href="../packages/ape/index.html">ape</a>), though the S4 phylo4 class (implemented in
<a href="../packages/phylobase/index.html">phylobase</a>) is also available.
<a href="../packages/ape/index.html">ape</a>
        can read trees from external files in newick format (sometimes popularly known as phylip format) or NEXUS format. It can also read trees input by hand as a newick string (i.e., "(human,(chimp,bonobo));").
<a href="../packages/treebase/index.html">treebase</a>
        can search for and load trees from the online tree repository TreeBASE. PHYLOCH can load trees from BEAST, MrBayes, and other phylogenetics programs (PHYLOCH is only available from the author's
