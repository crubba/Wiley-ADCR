        <em>
          DICOM
        </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The industry standard format, for data coming off a clinical
    imaging device, is
        <a href="http://dicom.nema.org">
          DICOM
        </a>
        (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine).  The DICOM
    "standard" is very broad and very complicated.  Roughly speaking
    each DICOM-compliant file is a collection of fields organized into
    two four-byte sequences (group,element) that are represented as
    hexadecimal numbers and form a
        <em>
          tag
        </em>.  The (group,element)
    combination announces what type of information is coming next.
    There is no fixed number of bytes for a DICOM header.  The final
    (group,element) tag should be the "data" tag (7FE0,0010), such
    that all subsequent information is related to the image(s).

      </p>
      <p>
        Although the industry standard for medical imaging data is
    DICOM, another format has come to be heavily used in the image
    analysis community.  The
        <a href="http://www.mayo.edu/bir/PDF/ANALYZE75.pdf">
          ANALYZE
        </a>
        format was originally developed in conjunction with an image
    processing system (of the same name) at the Mayo Foundation.  An
    Anlayze (7.5) format image is comprised of two files, the "hdr"
    and "img" files, that contain information about the acquisition
    and the acquisition itself, respectively.  A more recent adaption
    of this format is known as
        <a href="http://nifti.nimh.nih.gov/nifti-1">
          NIfTI-1
        </a>
        and is a
    product of the Data Format Working Group (DFWG) from the
    Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative (NIfTI).  The
    NIfTI-1 data format is almost identical to the ANALYZE format, but
    offers a few improvements: merging of the header and image
    information into one file (.nii), re-organization of the 348-byte
    fixed header into more relevant categories and the possibility of
    extending the header information.

<a href="../packages/oro.nifti/index.html">oro.nifti</a>.  Data management capabilities
      include: read/write for NIfTI extensions, full audit trail,

      as follows: motion correction and/or co-registration, T1
      estimation, conversion of signal intensity to gadolinium
      contrast-agent concentration and kinetic parameter estimation.
      Parametric estimation of the kinetic parameters, from a
      single-compartment (Kety or extended Kety) model, is performed
      via Levenburg-Marquardt optimization or Bayesian estimation.
      Semi-parametric estimation of the kinetic parameters is also

          The R package
