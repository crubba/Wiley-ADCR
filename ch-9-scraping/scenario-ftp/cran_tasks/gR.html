        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_model">
          Wikipedia
        </a>
        defines a graphical model as follows:
        <i>
          A graphical model is a
  probabilistic model for which a graph denotes the conditional
  independence structure between random variables. They are commonly
  used in probability theory, statistics - particularly Bayesian
  statistics and machine learning.
        </i>
      </p>
      A supplementary view is that graphical models are based on
  exploiting conditional independencies for constructing complex
  stochastic models with a modular structure. That is, a complex
  stochastic model is built up by simpler building blocks. 


  This task view is a collection of packages intended to supply R code
  to deal with graphical models.
      <p>
        The packages can be roughly structured into the following topics
  (although several of them have functionalities which go across these categories):

      undirected graphical Gaussian Markov models from data sets where
      the number of random variables p exceeds the available sample
      size n as, for instance, in the case of microarray data where
      they can be employed to reverse engineer a molecular regulatory
      network.

          The Hugin Decision Engine (HDE) is commercial software produced by 
      HUGIN EXPERT A/S for building and making inference from Bayesian
      belief networks. The
<a href="http://R-Forge.R-project.org/projects/rhugin/"><span class="Rforge">RHugin</span></a>
          package (available from R-Forge, not CRAN) provides a suite of
      functions allowing the HDE to be controlled from within the R
      environment for statistical computing. The
<a href="http://R-Forge.R-project.org/projects/rhugin/"><span class="Rforge">RHugin</span></a>
          package can
      thus be used to build Bayesian belief networks, enter and
      propagate evidence, and to retrieve beliefs. Additionally, the
<a href="http://R-Forge.R-project.org/projects/rhugin/"><span class="Rforge">RHugin</span></a>
          package can read and write hkb and NET files, making it
      easy to work simultaneously with both the
<a href="http://R-Forge.R-project.org/projects/rhugin/"><span class="Rforge">RHugin</span></a>
          package and the
      Hugin GUI. A licensed copy of the HDE (or the trial version) is
      required for the
<a href="http://R-Forge.R-project.org/projects/rhugin/"><span class="Rforge">RHugin</span></a>
          package to function, hence the target
      audience for the package is Hugin users who would like to take
      advantage of the statistical and programatic capabilities of R.
