        This CRAN Task View contains a list of packages useful for
      empirical work in Finance, grouped by topic.
      </p>
      <p>
        Besides these packages, a very wide variety of functions suitable for
      empirical work in Finance is provided by both the basic R 
      system (and its set of recommended core packages), and a number of
      other packages on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN). 
      Consequently, several of the other CRAN Task Views may contain suitable
      packages, in particular the
