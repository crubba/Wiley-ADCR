        Base R includes many functions that can be used for reading,
    visualising, and analysing spatial data. The focus in this view is on
    "geographical" spatial data, where observations can be identified
    with geographical locations, and where additional information about
    these locations may be retrieved if the location is recorded with
    care. Base R functions are complemented by contributed packages,
    some of which are on CRAN, and others are still in development. One
    active location is
        <a target="_top" href="http://R-Forge.R-project.org/">
          R-Forge
        </a>, which lists "Spatial Data and Statistics" projects in its
        <a target="_top" href="http://R-Forge.R-project.org/softwaremap/trove_list.php">
          project tree
        </a>. Information on R-spatial packages,
    especially
<a href="../packages/sp/index.html">sp</a>
        will be posted
    on the R-Forge rspatial project
        <a target="_top" href="http://rspatial.R-Forge.R-project.org/">
          website
        </a>, including
    a visualisation gallery.
      </p>
      <p>
        The
    contributed packages address two broad areas: moving spatial data
    into and out of R, and analysing spatial data in R.
      </p>
      <p>
        The
        <a href="https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/R-SIG-Geo/">
          R-SIG-Geo
        </a>
        mailing-list is a good place to begin for obtaining help and discussing
    questions about both accessing data, and analysing it. The mailing list
    is a good place to search for information about relevant courses, and a
    list is hosted at the
        <a href="http://geodacenter.asu.edu/projects/rsp">
          GeoDaCenter
        </a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The packages in this
    view can be roughly structured into the following topics. If you think
    that some package is missing from the list, please let me know. Please

              Classes for spatial data
            </b>: Because many of the
      packages importing and using spatial data have had to include
      objects of storing data and functions for visualising it,
      an initiative is in progress to construct shared classes
      and plotting functions for spatial data.
      The
<a href="../packages/sp/index.html">sp</a>
            package is discussed in a note in
            <a href="http://CRAN.R-project.org/doc/Rnews/Rnews_2005-2.pdf">
              R
      News
            </a>.  Many other packages have become dependent on these
      classes, including
<a href="../packages/rgdal/index.html">rgdal</a>
            and
<a href="../packages/maptools/index.html">maptools</a>. 
      Functions provided by
<a href="../packages/vec2dtransf/index.html">vec2dtransf</a>
            for applying affine 
      and similarity transformations on vector spatial data (sp objects). 
      The
<a href="../packages/rgeos/index.html">rgeos</a>
            package provides an interface to topology functions
      for
<a href="../packages/sp/index.html">sp</a>
            objects using
            <a href="http://trac.osgeo.org/geos/">

            </a>.
<a href="../packages/rgeos/index.html">rgeos</a>
            is now available for Mac OSX on CRAN.
      The
<a href="../packages/raster/index.html">raster</a>
            package is a major extension of spatial data 
      classes to virtualise access to large rasters, permitting large 
      objects to be analysed, and extending the analytical tools available 
      for both raster and vector data. Used with
<a href="../packages/rasterVis/index.html">rasterVis</a>, it
      can also provide enhanced visualisation and interaction. The
<a href="../packages/spatial.tools/index.html">spatial.tools</a>
            package contains spatial functions meant to 
      enhance the core functionality of the
<a href="../packages/raster/index.html">raster</a>
            package, 
      including a parallel processing engine for use with rasters.
      The
<a href="../packages/micromap/index.html">micromap</a>
            package provides linked micromaps using
      ggplot2.
      The
<a href="../packages/spacetime/index.html">spacetime</a>
            package 
      extends the shared classes defined in
<a href="../packages/sp/index.html">sp</a>
            for 
      spatio-temporal data (see
            <a href="http://www.jstatsoft.org/v51/i07">
              Spatio-Temporal Data in R
            </a>). The
<a href="../packages/Grid2Polygons/index.html">Grid2Polygons</a>
            converts a

      SpatialPolygonsDataFrame.

            package;
<a href="../packages/PBSmodelling/index.html">PBSmodelling</a>
            provides
      modelling support. In addition,
<a href="../packages/GEOmap/index.html">GEOmap</a>

              Handling spatial data
            </b>: A number of packages have
      been written using sp classes. The
<a href="../packages/raster/index.html">raster</a>
            package 
      introduces many GIS methods that now permit much to be done with 
      spatial data without having to use GIS in addition to R. It may be

<a href="../packages/gdistance/index.html">gdistance</a>, which provided calculation
      of distances and routes on geographic grids.
<a href="../packages/geosphere/index.html">geosphere</a>

      to be carried out on spatial data in geographical coordinates. 
      The

            package provides a
      range of sampling functions. The
<a href="../packages/trip/index.html">trip</a>
            package extends sp
      classes to permit the accessing and manipulating of spatial data for
      animal tracking. The
<a href="../packages/hdeco/index.html">hdeco</a>

      spatial data analysis.
<a href="../packages/spcosa/index.html">spcosa</a>

      sampling and random sampling from compact geographical strata.

              Spatial regression
            </b>:
      The choice of function for spatial regression will depend on the 
      support available. If the data are characterised by point support
      and the spatial process is continuous, geostatistical methods may be 
      used, or functions in the
<a href="../packages/nlme/index.html">nlme</a>
            package. If the support
      is areal, and the spatial process is not being treated as continuous,
      functions provided in the
<a href="../packages/spdep/index.html">spdep</a>
            package may be used.
      This package can also be seen as providing spatial econometrics
      functions, and, as noted above, provides basic functions for
      building neighbour lists and spatial weights, tests for spatial
      autocorrelation for areal data like Moran's I, and functions for
      fitting spatial regression models. It provides the full range of
      local indicators of spatial association, such as local Moran's I and
      diagnostic tools for fitted linear models, including Lagrange
      Multiplier tests. Spatial regression models that can be fitted using
      maximum likelihood include spatial lag models, spatial error models,
      and spatial Durbin models. For larger data sets, sparse matrix 
      techniques can be used for maximum likelihood fits, while spatial two
      stage least squares and generalised method of moments estimators are
      an alternative. When using GMM,
<a href="../packages/sphet/index.html">sphet</a>
