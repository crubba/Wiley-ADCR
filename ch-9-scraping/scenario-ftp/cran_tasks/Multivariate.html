      <p>
        Base R contains most of the functionality for classical multivariate analysis,
       somewhere. There are a large number of packages on CRAN which extend this methodology,
       a brief overview is given below. Application-specific uses of multivariate statistics
       are described in relevant task views, for example whilst principal components are listed here, 
       ordination is covered in the
<a href="Environmetrics.html">Environmetrics</a>
        task view.   Further information on supervised classification can be found in the
<a href="MachineLearning.html">MachineLearning</a>
        task view, and unsupervised classification in the
<a href="Cluster.html">Cluster</a>
        task view.
      </p>
      <p>
        The packages in this view can be roughly structured into the following topics.
       If you think that some package is missing from the list, please let me know.
