        Social scientists use a wide range of statistical methods. To make the burden carried by this task view lighter, I have suppressed detail in some areas that are well covered by related task views (e.g., the
<a href="Spatial.html">Spatial</a>
        task view for spatial statistics), and have pointed to those task views instead.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most statistical data analysis in the social sciences is covered by the facilities in the base and recommended packages, which are part of the standard R distribution. In the package descriptions below, I identify base and recommended packages on first mention; packages that are not specifically identified as "R-base" or "recommended" are contributed packages.
      </p>
      <p>
        One area of central interest to social scientists that I do not cover here is statistical graphics, even though this is one of the great strengths of R: Basic R graphics, trellis graphics (in the recommended
<a href="../packages/lattice/index.html">lattice</a>
        package), dynamic 3D graphs (via the
<a href="../packages/rgl/index.html">rgl</a>
        package), and the many packages that include facilities for various statistical graphs are just too extensive to detail here. Fortunately, a Graphics task view is currently in preparation.

          Linear and Generalized Linear Models:

      <p>
        Univariate and multivariate linear models are fit by the
<tt>lm</tt>
        function, generalized linear models by the
<tt>glm</tt>
        function, both in the R-base stats package. Beyond

<tt>plot</tt>
        methods for
<tt>lm</tt>
        and
<tt>glm</tt>
        objects, there is a wide array of functions that support these objects:

      <ul>
        <li>
          The generic
<tt>anova</tt>
          function in the stats package constructs sequential analysis of variance and analysis of deviance tables, and can compute
          <i>
            F
          </i>
          and likelihood-ratio tests for nested models. (It is typical for other classes of statistical models in R to have
<tt>anova</tt>
          methods as well.) The generic
<tt>Anova</tt>
          function in the
<a href="../packages/car/index.html">car</a>

<tt>linear.hypothesis</tt>
          function in the
<a href="../packages/car/index.html">car</a>

          A basic R installation has excellent facilities for linear and generalized linear model

	  residuals and Cook's distances (
<tt>hatvalues</tt>,
<tt>rstudent</tt>, and

<a href="../packages/car/index.html">car</a>
          package, which emphasizes graphical methods, e.g.,
<tt>cr.plots</tt>
          for component-plus-residual plots and
<tt>av.plots</tt>
          for added-variable plots, in addition to numerical diagnostics, such
<tt>vif</tt>
          for (generalized) variance-inflation factors; the
<a href="../packages/dr/index.html">dr</a>
          package for dimension reduction in regression, including SIR, SAVE, and pHd; and the
<a href="../packages/lmtest/index.html">lmtest</a>
          package, which implements a wide variety of tests (e.g., for heteroscedasticity, nonlinearity, and autocorrelation). More diagnostic methods, e.g., for inverse-response plots, may be found in the
<a href="../packages/alr3/index.html">alr3</a>
          package. The
<a href="../packages/forward/index.html">forward</a>
          package implements diagnostics based on a "forward search" (Atkinson and Riani,
          <i>
            Robust Diagnostic Regression Analysis,
          </i>
          Springer, 2000). Other collinearity diagnostics are in the

        </li>
        <li>
          Several packages contain functions that are useful for interpreting linear and generalized linear models that have been fit to data: The
<a href="../packages/qvcalc/index.html">qvcalc</a>
          packages computes "quasi variances" for factors in linear and generalized linear models (and more generally). The

          and
<a href="../packages/mitools/index.html">mitools</a>
          packages (the latter for drawing inferences from multiply imputed data sets). There are also some facilities for missing-data imputation in the general
