      <p>
        Base R ships with a lot of functionality useful for computational
    econometrics, in particular in the stats package. This
    functionality is complemented by many packages on CRAN, a brief overview
    is given below. There is also a considerable overlap between the tools
    for econometrics in this view and for finance in the
<a href="Finance.html">Finance</a>
        view.
    Furthermore, the
        <a href="https://www.stat.math.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/R-SIG-Finance/">
          Finance SIG
        </a>
        is a suitable mailing list for obtaining help
    and discussing questions about both computational finance and econometrics.
    Finally, there is also some overlap with the
<a href="SocialSciences.html">SocialSciences</a>
        that
    also covers a broad variety of tools for social sciences, e.g., including political science.
      </p>
      <p>
        The packages in this view can be roughly structured into the following topics.
    If you think that some package is missing from the list, please let me know.

	  from the books 'Forecasting with Exponential Smoothing: The State Space Approach'
	  (Hyndman, Koehler, Ord, Snyder, 2008, Springer) and 'Forecasting: Methods and Applications'
	  (Makridakis, Wheelwright, Hyndman, 3rd ed., 1998, Wiley) and the M-competitions,
	  respectively.

        <li>
          <i>
            Matrix manipulations
          </i>: As a vector- and matrix-based language, base R
          ships with many powerful tools for doing matrix manipulations, which are 
	  complemented by the packages
<a href="../packages/Matrix/index.html">Matrix</a>
          and
<a href="../packages/SparseM/index.html">SparseM</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>
            Optimization and mathematical programming
          </i>: R and many of its contributed
          packages provide many specialized functions for solving particular optimization
	  problems, e.g., in regression as discussed above. Further functionality for
	  solving more general optimization problems, e.g., likelihood maximization, is
	  discussed in the the
<a href="Optimization.html">Optimization</a>
          task view.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>
            Bootstrap
          </i>: In addition to the recommended
<a href="../packages/boot/index.html">boot</a>
          package,
          there are some other general bootstrapping techniques available in
<a href="../packages/bootstrap/index.html">bootstrap</a>
          or
<a href="../packages/simpleboot/index.html">simpleboot</a>
          as well some bootstrap techniques
	  designed for time-series data, such as the maximum entropy bootstrap in
<a href="../packages/meboot/index.html">meboot</a>
          or the
<tt>tsbootstrap()</tt>
          from
<a href="../packages/tseries/index.html">tseries</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>
            Inequality
          </i>: For measuring inequality, concentration and poverty the
          package
<a href="../packages/ineq/index.html">ineq</a>
          provides some basic tools such as Lorenz curves,
	  Pen's parade, the Gini coefficient and many more.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>
            Structural change
          </i>: R is particularly strong when dealing with
          structural changes and changepoints in parametric models, see
<a href="../packages/strucchange/index.html">strucchange</a>
          and
<a href="../packages/segmented/index.html">segmented</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>
            Exchange rate regimes
          </i>: Methods for inference about exchange
          rate regimes, in particular in a structural change setting, are provided
	  by
<a href="../packages/fxregime/index.html">fxregime</a>.
