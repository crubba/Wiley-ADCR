        This CRAN task view contains a list of packages which offer
  facilities for solving optimization problems.
  Although every regression model in statistics solves an optimization
  problem they are not part of this view. If you are looking for regression
  methods, the following views will contain useful starting points:
<a href="Multivariate.html">Multivariate</a>,
<a href="SocialSciences.html">SocialSciences</a>,
<a href="Robust.html">Robust</a>
        among others.
  The focus of this task view is on

        Many packages provide functionality for more than one
  of the subjects listed at the end of this task view. E.g., mixed
  integer linear programming solvers typically offer standard linear
  programming
  routines like the simplex algorithm. Therefore following each package
  description a list of abbreviations describes the typical features
  of the optimizer (i.e., the problems which can be solved). The
  full names of the abbreviations given in square brackets can be
  found at the end of this task view under

          Trying to unify optimization algorithms via a single wrapper
    function,
<a href="../packages/optimx/index.html">optimx</a>
          helps to proper specify the
    (nonlinear) optimization problem including objective function,
    gradient function, and scaling. This package supports the
    (local) optimization of smooth, nonlinear functions with at most
    box constraints (bounds).
<a href="../packages/optimx/index.html">optimx</a>
          depends not only on
    packages and/or functions mentioned in this section of this task
    view but also on two packages implemented by the author(s),
    namely
<a href="../packages/Rcgmin/index.html">Rcgmin</a>
          and
<a href="../packages/Rvmmin/index.html">Rvmmin</a>. Both are "pure
    R" implementations of conjugate gradient minimization and
    variable metric nonlinear function minimization algorithms,
    respectively.
        </li>
        <li>
          The R Optimization Infrastructure (<a href="../packages/ROI/index.html">ROI</a>) package
    provides a framework for handling optimization problems in R. It
    uses an object oriented approach to define and solve various
    optimization tasks in R which can be from different problem
    classes (e.g., linear, quadratic, non-linear programming
    problems). This makes optimization transparent for the R user as
    the corresponding workflow is completely abstracted from the
    underlying solver. Furthermore, this approach allows for easy
    switching between solvers, given that corresponding solver plugins
    are available, and thus enhances comparability.

          Package stats offers several general purpose optimization
    routines.
    First, function
<tt>optim()</tt>
          provides an implementation of
    the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) method,
    bounded BFGS, conjugate gradient, Nelder-Mead, and simulated
    annealing (SANN) optimization
    methods. It utilizes gradients, if provided, for faster
    convergence. Typically it is used for unconstrained optimization
    but includes an option for box-constrained
    optimization.

    Additionally, for minimizing a function subject to
    linear inequality constraints stats contains the routine
<tt>constrOptim()</tt>.

    For one-dimensional unconstrained function optimization there is
<tt>optimize()</tt>
          which searches an interval
    for a minimum or maximum.

    Then there is
<tt>nlm</tt>
          which is used for solving nonlinear
    unconstrained minimization problems. Eventually,
<tt>nlminb()</tt>
          offers unconstrained and constrained
    optimization using PORT routines. [RGA, QN]

        Interfaces to Commercial Optimizers

      This section surveys interfaces to commercial solvers. Typically, the
  corresponding libraries have to be installed separately.

          <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/integration/optimization/cplex-optimizer/">
            IBM
          </a>. CPLEX
    provides dual/primal simplex optimizers as well as a barrier
    optimizer for solving large scale linear and quadratic
    programs. Furthermore, it offers a mixed integer optimizer to
    solve difficult mixed integer programs. Note that CPLEX is
          <b>
            not

    solving LP and QP problems this solver can handle SOCP and
    quadratically constrained programming (QPQC) tasks. Furthermore,
    it offers a mixed integer optimizer to solve difficult mixed
    integer programs (MILP, MISOCP, etc.). Note that you have to get a
