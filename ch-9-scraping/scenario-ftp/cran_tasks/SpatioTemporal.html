        This task view aims at presenting R packages that are useful for 
  the analysis of spatio-temporal data.

        Although one could argue that all data are spatio-temporal, as they
  must have been taken somewhere and at some point in time, in
  many cases the spatial locations or times of observation are not
  registered, and irrelevant to the purpose of the study. Here,
  we will address the cases where both location
        <em>
          and
        </em>
        time
  of observation are registered, and relevant for the analysis of
  the data.  The
<a href="Spatial.html">Spatial</a>
        and
<a href="TimeSeries.html">TimeSeries</a>
        task views shed light on spatial, and temporal data handling and
  analysis, individually.

          <b>
            In long tables:
          </b>
          In some cases, spatio-temporal data can be held in tables
  (
<tt>data.frame</tt>
          objects), with longitude, latitude and
  time as three of the columns, or an identifier for a location
  or region and time as columns. For instance, data sets in
  package
<a href="../packages/plm/index.html">plm</a>
          for linear panel models have repeated
  observations for observational units, where these units often
  refer to spatial areas (countries, states) by an index. This index
  (a name, or number) can be matched to the spatial coordinates
  (polygons) of the corresponding area, an example of this is given
  by
          <a href="http://www.jstatsoft.org/v51/i07/">
            Pebesma (2012, Journal of Statistical Software)
          </a>. As these
  data sets usually contain more than one attribute, to hold the
  data in a two-dimensional table a
          <em>
            long table
          </em>
          form is
  chosen, where each record contains the index of the observational
  unit, observation time, and all attributes.

          When a single attribute is considered, another layout is that
  of the
          <em>
            time-wide table
          </em>, where each observational
  unit forms a record and each column an observation time.

  full space-time grids (every observational unit contains an
  observation for each observation time), sparse space-time grids
  (regular, but incomplete grids), irregular space-time data
  (each observational unit is observed at its own time), and
  has limited support for trajectory data.
