      Psychometrics is concerned with the design and analysis of research and
the measurement of human characteristics. Psychometricians have also
worked collaboratively with those in the field of statistics and
quantitative methods to develop improved ways to organize and analyze
data.  Since much functionality is already contained in base R and there
is considerable overlap between tools for psychometry and tools
described in other views, particularly in
<a href="SocialSciences.html">SocialSciences</a>,
we only give a brief overview of packages that are closely related to
psychometric methodology.
      <p>

something of importance, or if a new package or function
should be mentioned here.

     Rasch model for dichotomous data (RM), the linear logistic test model
     (LLTM), the rating scale model (RSM) and its linear extension (LRSM),
     the partial credit model (PCM) and its linear extension (LPCM) using
     conditional ML estimation. Missing values are allowed.

        <li>
          The package
<a href="../packages/ltm/index.html">ltm</a>
