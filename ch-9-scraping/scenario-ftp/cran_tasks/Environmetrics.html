      <h4>
        Introduction
      </h4>
      <p>
        This Task View contains information about using R to analyse ecological and environmental data.
      </p>
      <p>
        The base version of R ships with a wide range of functions for use within the field of environmetrics.
      This functionality is complemented by a plethora of packages available via CRAN, which provide specialist
      methods such as ordination &amp; cluster analysis techniques. A brief overview of the available packages is 
      provided in this Task View, grouped by topic or type of analysis. As a testament to the popularity of R for the 
      analysis of environmental and ecological data, a

        A list of available packages and functions is presented below, grouped by analysis type.
      </p>
      <h4>
        General packages
      </h4>
      <p>
        These packages are general, having wide applicability to the environmetrics field.

          Package
<a href="../packages/EnvStats/index.html">EnvStats</a>
          is the successor to the S-PLUS module

      <h4>
        Modelling species responses and other data
      </h4>
      <p>
        Analysing species response curves or modeling other data often involves the fitting of standard statistical models 
      to ecological data and includes simple (multiple) regression, Generalised Linear Models (GLM), extended regression 
      (e.g. Generalised Least Squares [GLS]), Generalised Additive Models (GAM), and mixed effects models, amongst 
      others.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The base installation of R provides
<tt>lm()</tt>
          and
<tt>glm()</tt>
          for fitting linear and generalised
	linear models, respectively.
        </li>
        <li>
          Generalised least squares and linear and non-linear mixed effects models extend the simple regression model
	to account for clustering, heterogeneity and correlations within the sample of observations. Package
<a href="../packages/nlme/index.html">nlme</a>
          provides functions for fitting these models. The package is supported by Pinheiro &amp; Bates (2000)
          <em>
            Mixed-effects Models in S and S-PLUS
          </em>, Springer, New York. An updated approach to mixed effects models, 
	which also fits Generalised Linear Mixed Models (GLMM) and Generalised non-Linear Mixed Models (GNLMM) is provided 
	by the
<a href="../packages/lme4/index.html">lme4</a>
          package, though this is currently beta software and does not yet allow correlations within 
	the error structure.
        </li>
        <li>
          Recommended package
<a href="../packages/mgcv/index.html">mgcv</a>
          fits GAMs and Generalised Additive Mixed Models (GAMM) with 
	automatic smoothness selection via generalised cross-validation. The author of
<a href="../packages/mgcv/index.html">mgcv</a>

	also written a companion monograph, Wood (2006)
          <em>
            Generalized Additive Models; An Introduction with R
          </em>
          Chapman Hall/CRC, which has an accompanying package

        </li>
        <li>
          Alternatively, package
<a href="../packages/gam/index.html">gam</a>
          provides an implementation of the S-PLUS function
<tt>gam()</tt>
          that 
	includes LOESS smooths.

<a href="../packages/pscl/index.html">pscl</a>
              also contains several functions for dealing with over-dispersed count data. Poisson or 
	    negative binomial distributions are provided for both zero-inflated and hurdle models.
            </li>
            <li>
<a href="../packages/aod/index.html">aod</a>
              provides a suite of functions to analyse overdispersed counts or proportions, plus utility 
	    functions to calculate e.g. AIC, AICc, Akaike weights.

      <h4>
        Tree-based models
      </h4>
      <p>
        Tree-based models are being increasingly used in ecology, particularly for their ability to fit flexible models to
      complex data sets and the simple, intuitive output of the tree structure. Ensemble methods such as bagging, boosting and
      random forests are advocated for improving predictions from tree-based models and to provide information on uncertainty
      in regression models or classifiers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tree-structured models for regression, classification and survival analysis, following the ideas in the CART book, 
      are implemented in
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          recommended package

        </li>
        <li>
<a href="../packages/party/index.html">party</a>
          provides an implementation of conditional inference trees which embed tree-structured regression 
	models into a well defined theory of conditional inference procedures

      </ul>
      <p>
        Multivariate trees are available in
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          package

<a href="../packages/rpart/index.html">rpart</a>

        </li>
        <li>
          package
<a href="../packages/party/index.html">party</a>
          can also handle multivariate responses.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Ensemble techniques for trees:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The Random Forest method of Breiman and Cutler is implemented in
<a href="../packages/randomForest/index.html">randomForest</a>, providing classification 
	and regression based on a forest of trees using random inputs
        </li>
        <li>
          Package
<a href="../packages/ipred/index.html">ipred</a>
          provides functions for improved predictive models for classification, regression and 
	survival problems.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Graphical tools for the visualization of trees are available in package
<a href="../packages/maptree/index.html">maptree</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Packages
<a href="../packages/mda/index.html">mda</a>
        and
<a href="../packages/earth/index.html">earth</a>
        implement Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), a technique
      which provides a more flexible, tree-based approach to regression than the piecewise constant functions used in 
      regression trees.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Ordination
      </h4>
      <p>
        R and add-on packages provide a wide range of ordination methods, many of which are specialised techniques
      particularly suited to the analysis of species data. The two main packages are
<a href="../packages/ade4/index.html">ade4</a>
        and
<a href="../packages/vegan/index.html">vegan</a>.
<a href="../packages/ade4/index.html">ade4</a>
        derives from the traditions of the French school of
        <q>
          Analyse des Donnees
        </q>
        and is based on the use of the duality diagram.
<a href="../packages/vegan/index.html">vegan</a>
        follows
      the approach of Mark Hill, Cajo ter Braak and others, though the implementation owes more to that presented in
      Legendre &amp; Legendre (1988)
        <em>
          Numerical Ecology, 2
          <sup>
            nd
          </sup>
          English Edition
        </em>, Elsevier. Where the
      two packages provide duplicate functionality, the user should choose whichever framework that best suits their 
      background.

        Dissimilarity coefficients
      </h4>
      <p>
        Much ecological analysis proceeds from a matrix of dissimilarities between samples. A large amount of effort has
      been expended formulating a wide range of dissimilarity coefficients suitable for ecological data. A selection of
      the more useful coefficients are available in R and various contributed packages.

<tt>distance()</tt>
        can also be used to generate

      <h4>
        Cluster analysis
      </h4>
      <p>
        Cluster analysis aims to identify groups of samples within multivariate data sets. A large range of 
      approaches to this problem have been suggested, but the main techniques are hierarchical cluster analysis, 
      partitioning methods, such as
        <em>
          k
        </em>
        -means, and finite mixture models or model-based clustering. In the machine 
      learning literature, cluster analysis is an unsupervised learning problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        The
<a href="Cluster.html">Cluster</a>
        task view provides a more detailed discussion of available cluster analysis methods and 
      appropriate R functions and packages.

        This section concerns estimation of population parameters (population size, density, survival probability, site occupancy
      etc.) by methods that allow for incomplete detection. Many of these methods use data on marked animals, variously called 
      'capture-recapture', 'mark-recapture' or 'capture-mark-recapture' data.
