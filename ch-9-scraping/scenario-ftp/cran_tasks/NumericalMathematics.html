      <p>
        This task view on numerical mathematics lists R packages and functions 
    that are useful for solving numerical problems in linear algebra and 
    analysis. It shows that R is a viable computing environment for 
    implementing and applying numerical methods, also outside the realm of 
    statistics.
      </p>
      <p>
        The task view will
        <em>
          not
        </em>
        cover differential equations, 
    optimization problems and solvers, or packages and functions operating 
    on times series, because all these topics are treated extensively in 
    the corresponding task views
<a href="DifferentialEquations.html">DifferentialEquations</a>,
<a href="Optimization.html">Optimization</a>, and
<a href="TimeSeries.html">TimeSeries</a>. All these task 
    views together will provide a good selection of what is available in R for 
    the area of numerical mathematics.
      </p>
      <p>
        The task view has been created to provide an overview of the topic. 
    If some packages are missing or certain topics in numerical math 
    should be treated in more detail, please let the maintainer know.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Numerical Linear Algebra
      </h4>
      <p>
        As statistics is based to a large extent on linear algebra, many 
    numerical linear algebra routines are present in R, and some only 
    implicitly. Examples of explicitly available functions are vector and 
    matrix operations, matrix (QR) decompositions, solving linear equations, 
    eigenvalues/-vectors, singular value decomposition, or least-squares 
    approximation.

        'Yacas'. It supports symbolic and arbitrary precision computations 
        in calculus and linear algebra.

      <h4>
        MATLAB, Octave, and Python Interfaces
      </h4>
      <p>
        Interfaces to numerical computation software such as MATLAB 
    (commercial) or Octave (free) will be important when solving difficult 
    numerical problems. Please note that the commercial programs SAS and 
    Mathematica do have facilities to call R functions.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The
<a href="../packages/matlab/index.html">matlab</a>
          emulation package contains about 30 simple 
        functions, replicating MATLAB functions, using the respective MATLAB 
        names and being implemented in pure R.
        </li>
        <li>
          Package
<a href="../packages/R.matlab/index.html">R.matlab</a>
          provides tools to read and write MAT 
        files, which is the MATLAB data format. It also enables a 
        one-directional interface with a MATLAB process, sending and 
        retrieving objects through a TCP/IP connection.
        </li>
        <li>
          Package
<a href="../packages/RcppOctave/index.html">RcppOctave</a>
          provides an interface to Octave (a 
        MATLAB clone). It enables calling Octave functions, passing variables 
        between R and Octave, and browsing Octave documentation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Python, through its modules 'NumPy', 'SciPy', and 'pandas', has 
        elaborate and efficient numerical tools available. R package
<a href="../packages/rPython/index.html">rPython</a>
          permits calls from R to Python, while project
          <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/rpy/">
            RPy
          </a>
          (with Python 
        module 'rpy2') interfaces R from Python.
